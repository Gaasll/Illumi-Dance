# Illumi-Dance

The purpose of the proposed project is to develop a smart lighting system that can be controlled via a web
application using Wi-Fi. Compared to conventional lighting fixtures and bulbs, this system offers more
flexibility, convenience, and energy efficiency. The productâ€™s design aims to create a lighting solution that
is user-friendly, adaptable, and energy-efficient. It is intended to be a sustainable alternative that effectively
reduces energy consumption. The lighting system will be easy to use and will adapt to the changing needs
of its users
