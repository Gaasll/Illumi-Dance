# Illumi-Dance

The purpose of the proposed project is to develop a smart lighting system that can be controlled via a web
application using Wi-Fi. Compared to conventional lighting fixtures and bulbs, this system offers more
flexibility, convenience, and energy efficiency. The product’s design aims to create a lighting solution that
is user-friendly, adaptable, and energy-efficient. It is intended to be a sustainable alternative that effectively
reduces energy consumption. The lighting system will be easy to use and will adapt to the changing needs
of its users

## Vison

This product addresses the growing demand for lighting solutions in home decoration,
entertainment, and events, appealing to a wide range of customers and stakeholders. Unlike existing
products, Illumi-Dance has the ability to set an alarm for the light show. Users can set the alarm in the
web-app, and 30 minutes before the alarm goes off, the LED lights will automatically turn on and start the
”sunrise” show without sound. This feature is perfect for people who want to wake up to a gently simulated
sunlight instead of a traditional alarm clock.



## Product features

The product features are categorized into two groups: basic and advanced. Our goal is to deliver the basic
features by the end of the project, and we will implement advanced features if we have enough time. You
can find the product features listed below.

## Basic features:

* The system will include seven LED effects such as chaser, blink, fade, and pulse to give users a
variety of options to choose from.
* Users will be able to control the LED effects through a webapp interface, making it easy and intuitive
to save their favorite LED light shows.
* The system will save previous states regularly.
* The web-app will have a login authentication.
* The web-app will have an end-to-end secured communication
* The system will have a timer function that triggers the lighting system to turn on or off at the specified
times.

## Advanced features:
* Provide users with the ability to customize their own patterns and save them in the web-app.
* The app sends push up notifications on the phone for example when the lights are turned on after a
timer-based show.
* Add a sensor that automatically adjusts the brightness level according to the time of day (increasing
it during daylight and decreasing it during nighttime).
